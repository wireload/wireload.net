            <p>In digital realms where ideas soar,</p>
            <p>Once stood WireLoad, with products galore.</p>
            <p>Blotter, its child, on macOS did reign,</p>
            <p>Painting timeâ€™s canvas, not in vain.</p>

            <p>A calendar, sleek, on desktops it lay,</p>
            <p>Uniting the moments of each day.</p>
            <p>In hues and shades of practical art,</p>
            <p>It organized time, playing its part.</p>

            <p>YippieMove too, in WireLoad's keep,</p>
            <p>Migrated emails, a digital leap.</p>
            <p>From server to server, it danced with ease,</p>
            <p>Shifting messages like a gentle breeze.</p>

            <p>But times do change, as stars do align,</p>
            <p>WireLoad's journey took a new design.</p>
            <p>Merged with <a href="https://www.screenly.io">Screenly</a>, vibrant and keen,</p>
            <p>In digital signage, now they're seen.</p>

            <p>Screenly shines bright in its new quest,</p>
            <p>With WireLoad's spirit in its chest.</p>
            <p>Together they stride in digital skies,</p>
            <p>Where innovation and dreams never die.</p>

            <p>So here we stand, at a chapter's close,</p>
            <p>Remembering WireLoad, in prose.</p>
            <p>Its legacy lingers in Screenly's wake,</p>
            <p>A testament to the paths we take.</p>
