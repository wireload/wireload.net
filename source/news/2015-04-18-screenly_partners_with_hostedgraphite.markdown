One of the most popular use cases for Screenly that we have seen in recent times is [dashboards](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard.html). A lot of customers are adopting Screenly to display all sorts of dashboards, ranging from [Chartbeat](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/chartbeat.html) to [Nagios](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/nagios.html) and [New Relic](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/newrelic.html).

Because of the popularity of using Screenly to display dashboards, we're really excited to team up with [HostedGraphite](http://hostedgraphite.com/); the leading hosted [Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web) service.

For those not familiar with Graphite, it is a very popular tool for graphing all kind of data, such as Business Intelligence (BI) and application metrics. Simply put, it is a great way to visualize your data.

In addition to Graphite, HostedGraphite also [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), which is a separate graphing tool which you can use to render the same data sets.

Thanks to our partnership with HostedGraphite, it is now super easy to add your dashboards from HostedGraphite to Screenly. We've even put up a [quick tutorial](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/hostedgraphite.html) on how to do this.

You can sign up for your 14 day free trial of HostedGraphite [here](https://www.hostedgraphite.com/accounts/signup/).
