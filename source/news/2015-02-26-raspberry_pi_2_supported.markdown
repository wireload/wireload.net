We're excited to announce that both Screenly Pro and OSE now supports the new [Raspberry Pi 2 (Model B)](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/). Thanks to the performance improvements in the new hardware, Screenly is now faster than ever. The difference is really noticable on heavier web pages.

 * **Screenly OSE:** Please visit [this](http://www.screenlyapp.com/ose.html) page.
 * **Screenly Pro:** Log into your account and you'll find the updated image under 'Add Screen'.
