This is the February update for Screenly, where you can read about the latest updates to [Screenly](http://www.screenlyapp.com).

## Wireless Support

In the [last update](/news/2015/11/wifi_stability_improvements_and_more.html) we announced WiFi beta support. Today, we are happy to announce that the beta was a success, and that we are now extending the feature to general availability. We still strongly recommend that you use a wired connection for any production deployments, but if that is not possible, you now have the ability to use WiFi as well.

You can read more about the WiFi support [here](https://www.screenlyapp.com/faq/pro/#wifi_support).


## Asset Grouping

A number of our users have built successful businesses on top of Screenly. Naturally, many of these companies are starting to have a large repository of assets in Screenly. Over the past year, we've been contacted by a number of these users asking us to add the ability to group assets into folders to make the asset repository more manageable.

To make your life easier, we've now added support for being able to group assets in Screenly.

## Lots and lots improvements behind the scenes

We've spent a lot of development time in the last few months improving things behind the scenes. As Screenly is growing (and we've seen a lot of growth recently), it's important that we build a solid foundation for Screenly on the back-end. This is exactly what we are working on.


## Pre-flashed SD cards available

Thanks to our partner Pi Supply, you can now order pre-flashed SD cards with Screenly. These SD cards available for both Screenly Pro and OSE and can be purchased from [here](https://www.pi-supply.com/product/screenly-software-sd-cards-pro-and-ose/).

## Linux User & Digest coverage

Linux User & Digest published an in-depth article about Screenly titled "Digital Signage with Screenly". If you're in the U.K., you can likely find the magazine in your local store. If you don't feel like leaving your desk, you can also read the article on [their website](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/news/understanding-digital-signage-with-screenly).

(If you're thinking that it was a strange interview, you're right. It was a fully transcribed Skype interview, which explains the verbal tone of voice.)


## Screenly V2 Beta Invite

For some time, we've been working on a new Screenly Player module. We demonstrated the power of the new Screenly Pro player module at TechCrunch Disrupt and received a huge amount of interest. We're looking to opening up the V2 player beta to some beta customers in Q2. If you're interested in participating in the beta, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fX4zgBC6FrrHJ5VtpmoBXlP90rMc_Gcm04T0OY0yejE/viewform).

# Past Events

Since the last newsletter, we've been busy with attending lots of events. It has been a lot of fun, and we've been able to meet a number of users in person.

## BBVA IoT event

First out was BBVA's [IoT Day](https://www.bbva.es/eng/particulares/index.jsp) in Madrid, Spain. Together with [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) and [Cloud.net](https://www.cloud.net) we spent the morning talking about Screenly, Ubuntu Snappy Core, and IoT in general. During the afternoon, we held a hands-on lab where the participants could work on their own projects with our help.


## Betabeers

While in Madrid, we were also invited to speak at [Betabeers](https://betabeers.com/), which is the largest tech meet up series in Spain. We were greeted by an eager group of techies and covered Screenly as a use case for IoT.


## Pi Wars

In December, we had a booth at [Pi Wars](http://piwars.org/) – the Raspberry Pi robotics challenge competition in Cambridge together with our partner [Pi Supply](https://www.pi-supply.com). Rumor has it that it was the biggest Raspberry Pi event to date, and it surely was a full house. Not only did we get to meet a number of users, but we also got to hang out with the Eben and Liz from the Raspberry Pi foundation.


## TechCrunch Disrupt London

Just a few days after Pi Wars, we headed over to TechCrunch's [Disrupt London](http://techcrunch.com/event-info/disrupt-london-2015/) to join our friends over at [ArcticStartup](http://arcticstartup.com/). At Disrupt we gave a sneak-peek of the upcoming version 2 of our player module. People who walked by our booth were blown away about how far we could push the Raspberry Pi.


# Upcoming Events

In addition to working on making Screenly even more awesome, we also have a packed schedule with events this spring.


## Mobile World Congress (MWC)

Later this month, on February 22-25th, we will be at [Mobile World Congress](https://www.mobileworldcongress.com) in Barcelona, Spain. Mobile World Congress is the world’s largest gathering for the mobile industry. You'll find us in Canonical/Ubuntu's booth.


## Raspberry Pi's 4th Birthday Party

During the first weekend of March (5-6th), we be in Cambridge for the big Raspberry Pi's 4th [Birthday Party](https://www.raspberrypi.org/birthday/). If you're there, please swing by and say hi.


## CappCon 2016

If you're into the [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/) framework, you should attend [CapppCon 2016](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/events/cappCon2016/) on the 31st of March in Belgium. There, you'll find [Alexander](https://twitter.com/slevenbits) (Screenly's co-founder) giving the keynote speech.

## Cloud Expo Europe

If you're planning to attend [Cloud Expo Europe](http://www.cloudexpoeurope.com/) in London on April 13th, you should head over to the Service Provider & Cloud Ecosystem Technology Theatre at 14:30. If you do so, you'll find that [Viktor](https://twitter.com/vpetersson) (Screenly's co-founder) will be on the panel *"Future containers, virtualization, or both?"*.
