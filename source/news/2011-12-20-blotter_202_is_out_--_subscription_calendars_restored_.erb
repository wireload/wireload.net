Blotter 2.0.2 is finally available in the Mac App Store. In addition to the further improving the Snow Leopard support, Blotter 2.0.2 also resolves the issue with subscribed calendars from iCal. This means that your subscribed Google Calendar should appear just like they did in 1.4, but with the new beautiful user interface of 2.0.
