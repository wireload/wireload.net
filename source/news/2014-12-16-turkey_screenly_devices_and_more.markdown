Ever since we first launched Screenly we&rsquo;ve received requests from customers for turnkey Screenly devices. Many customers simply wanted to order a pre-configured Screenly device, plug it into the wall and be ready to go. Starting today, this is possible.

### Added support for static IPs
In order to offer such a solution, we&rsquo;ve teamed up with the fine folks over at [Pi Supply](https://www.pi-supply.com/). Together we have developed a [Screenly Pro starter kit](https://www.pi-supply.com/product/screenly-pro-digital-signage-starter-kit/).

The kit includes:

* Raspberry Pi Model B+
* Casing
* HDMI Cable
* Power Supply of your choice (UK/EU/USA/AUS)
* 8GB (Class 10) Samsung microSD Card with Screenly pre-installed

These pre-configured Screenly devices are available today for just &pound;60 and you can order them from [here](https://www.pi-supply.com/product/screenly-pro-digital-signage-starter-kit).

### Added support for static IPs

One feature that we have received requests for from a number of users over the last year has been support for static IPs. Up until now, if you wanted to use Screenly Pro, we required a DHCP server to be present on the network (which is the case for the vast majority of all networks). Some customers (in particular enterprises) require static IPs for all devices on a network.

We are today excited to announce that the latest version of Screenly Pro (*2014-12-12*) supports static IPs. The details on how to configure this can be found [here](https://login.screenlyapp.com/doc/faq#static_ip). In short you simply edit a file on the SD card before you boot the device, and the system will automatically configure itself accordingly.
