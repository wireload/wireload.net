This is the May update for Screenly, where you can read about the latest updates to [Screenly](http://www.screenlyapp.com).

## Reseller Program

Since we first launched Screenly, we've received a large number of requests from companies around the globe to resell Screenly.

We always planned to work closely with partners around the world to help us get closer to our users. That's why we're very happy to today announce that we have started to accept applications into our [Reseller Program](https://www.screenlyapp.com/reseller.html).

The concept is simple: we team up with companies around the globe that can help end-users with everything from installations to content creation. In return, these companies get a cut from the subscription revenue of Screenly, while they also have the opportunity to charge for extra services. The goal is to create a better experience for all involved parties.

## New Partner: Hosted Graphite

Earlier this month we announced a partnership with [Hosted Graphite](http://wireload.net/news/2015/04/screenly_partners_with_hostedgraphite.html). As we are seeing more and more users using Screenly as [dashboard devices](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard.html), we want to make this as easy as possible for our users.

Hosted Graphite offers Graphite and Grafana (among other things) as a service, which makes it very simple to create awesome dashboards for the metrics that you care about. Once you have these dashboards created, Screenly is the ultimate tool for bringing those metrics up on the big screen.

## Improved Network Support

As we are growing the user base for Screenly, we run into more and more non-standard network configurations. We've already [supported Static IPs](https://www.screenlyapp.com/faq/pro.html#static_ip) for some time. However, we are now happy to announce that our network configuration has become even more powerful.

Starting with the _2015-05-19_ disk image of Screenly, we also support the ability to use [custom NTP server(s)](https://www.screenlyapp.com/faq/pro.html#custom_ntp) as well as using [custom DNS server(s)](https://www.screenlyapp.com/faq/pro.html#custom_dns) even with DHCP.

## Improved debug logging

Because we have encountered more complicated networks, we have also extended our [USB debugging tool](https://www.screenlyapp.com/faq/pro.html#debugging) to perform more tests. As such, most of the situations that we encounter when troubleshooting installations should now be covered by the debugging tool.

## More use cases

If you haven't visited our website recently, you'll be happy to learn that we have added a lot more content. One of the things that we have spent a fair amount of resources on has been to develop [use cases](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/) together with our customers. You'll find a lot of industry specific use cases, such as [education](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/education.html), [restaurants](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/restaurants.html), and [retail](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/retail.html).

Under our use cases section, you will also find a number of application and service specific use cases. For instance, you can find use cases for everything from how to use [Geckoboard](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/geckoboard.html) to [Google Calendar](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/google_calendar.html) to [PowerPoint](https://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/applications/powerpoint.html).
