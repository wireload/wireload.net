When we launched Blotter, wireload.net looked really ugly. It was way
overdue for an update, but we didn't have time to deal with it at the
time. Instead, we launched Blotter on its own website on the domain
BlotterApp.com. That was a great move at the time, but now as we've
added more Mac OS applications to our portfolio and now that we've
revamped wireload.net, it was time to move Blotter back home. When doing
so, we also took the opportunity to redesign the page to better fit in.

So without further ado, we present to you: [the new Blotter product
page](/products/blotter/).
