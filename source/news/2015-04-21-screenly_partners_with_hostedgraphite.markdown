One of the most popular use cases for Screenly that we have seen in recent times is [dashboards](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard.html). A lot of customers are adopting Screenly to display all sorts of dashboards, ranging from [Chartbeat](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/chartbeat.html) to [Nagios](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/nagios.html) and [New Relic](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/newrelic.html).

Because of the popularity of using Screenly to display dashboards, we're really excited to announce that we have partnered up with the fine people over at [HostedGraphite](http://hostedgraphite.com/), the leading hosted [Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web) service.

For those not familiar with Graphite, it is a very popular tool for graphing all kinds of data, such as Business Intelligence (BI) and application metrics. Simply put, it is a great way to visualize your data.

In addition to Graphite, HostedGraphite also provides [Grafana](https://www.hostedgraphite.com/hosted-grafana), a separate graphing tool you can use to render data sets in a nicer way.

Thanks to our partnership with HostedGraphite, it is now super easy to add your dashboards from HostedGraphite to Screenly. We've even put up a [quick tutorial](http://www.screenlyapp.com/use-cases/dashboard/hostedgraphite.html) on how to do this.

You can sign up for your 14 day free trial of HostedGraphite [here](https://www.hostedgraphite.com/accounts/signup/).
