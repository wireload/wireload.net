MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA -- July 29, 2009 -- WireLoad has today unveiled a major new addition to their popular SaaS email migration tool. The new service is named YippieMove Custom Domain, and targets email hosting providers who are looking to easily add email migration to their list of services.<br/><strong>A Turn-key Solution</strong><br/>YippieMove Custom Domain is a complete turn-key solution. With Custom Domain, email hosting providers are able to put a custom version of YippieMove on their own domain (eg. migration.domain.com). Furthermore, YippieMove Custom Domain can be customized both in design, transfer conditions and payment terms to fit the provider’s needs. <br/><strong>Both for small and large providers</strong><br/>Regardless if the email hosting provider has 50 or 500,000 new clients per month, YippieMove Custom Domain is an innovative way to offer email migration to the clients without having to spend valuable internal resources.   <br/><strong>Simplicity</strong><br/>Based on the same interface and technology as <a href="http://www.YippieMove.com">YippieMove.com</a>, YippieMove Custom Domain enables the average user to perform the email migration. Traditionally, this task has been reserved for experienced IT administrators. <br/><strong>No download required</strong><br/>Contrary to most other email migration tools, YippieMove does not require any downloads. Everything the client need to start the migration process is his web-browser. This also means that the transfer is performed directly on YippieMove’s servers. Hence, a transfer that could take days with a broadband connection can be completed within hours. <br/><strong>Turn on the autopilot</strong><br/>The transfer is entirely automated. You can sit back while YippieMove finds and transfers your emails - complete with headers, text and attachments. Even errors are handled by automatic retries.<br/>To learn more about YippieMove Custom Domain, please visit <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/custom_domain.html">http://www.yippiemove.com/help/custom_domain.html</a>
