WireLoad is proud to introduce <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com">YippieMove</a>: Email migration made easy. With YippieMove, email migration just got a bit less painful.Â Have you ever been in a situation where you had to leave an email account behind? If so, you've probably faced the decision of either losing all those emails, or forwarding each and every one of them by hand. Neither of those choices are very appealing. Because of that, we developed YippieMove.<br/>YippieMove helps you migrate all your emails in three simple steps.<br/><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the from-account. You can use either one of the pre-configured account types, or 'other,' where you have to fill out the server settings yourself (this can be any IMAP compatible server).<br/><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the destination. At this point, we only support Gmail. However, more destinations will be added shortly. The reason why we decided to use Gmail initially was due to the generous storage limit as well as the widespread usage.<br/><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select folders to transfer. In this step you select the folders in the from-account that you wish to transfer. We try to make an educated guess about what folders you may want to transfer (excluding spam, junk etc.). The default setting should be sufficient for most users.<br/>That's it. Your transfer will be processed as soon as possible. We don't think email migration could get any easier than that.<br/>For a more technical discussion about YippieMove, please see our <a href="http://www.playingwithwire.com/2008/07/wireload-introduces-yippiemove/">article</a> on <a href="http://www.playingwithwire.com">Playing With Wire</a>.<br/>Ps.
