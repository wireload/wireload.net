Like most app developers, the first thing we do in the morning is to open up App Store to see how we're doing in the rankings. One morning about a month ago, we found something really odd.  There were not only one <a href="http://wireload.net/products/quiet/">Quiet</a>, but two. Did we develop a new application in our sleep again? And if so, why did we name it the same as our existing app? There were more questions than answers. We were aware of Quiet Read, but really, there were two Quiet.<br/><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-399" title="Are we seeing double?" src="/uploads/2011/05/before-580x342.png" alt="Are we seeing double?" width="580" height="342" /><!--more--><br/>After a few more sips of coffee, we noticed that the other Quiet was in fact called 'Quiet!' and not just 'Quiet.' After some further investigating, we found that 'Quiet!' was a pretty cool app. It allows you to mute and unmute your Mac over the network (via a built-in webserver). That's obviously very different from the functionality of Quiet (which helps you to focus), but it was still bad. How did this happen?<br/>How could Apple let trough two applications with the same name? Quiet was first in the App Store, and then Quiet! got approved later on. Did we just run across a massive problem in Apple's approval system? Can you just add '!' to the name of any existing application name? We don't know the answer to this, but we wanted to do something about our problem, so we reached out to Apple Legal. A while later we heard back from Robert Cotey, the author of 'Quiet!'. After bouncing a few emails back and forth, Robert was kind enough give up on the name 'Quiet!' and to rename his application to '<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remotely-quiet/id438744055?mt=12">Remotely Quiet</a>.'<br/>Today, Robert reached out to us and informed us that he had pulled 'Quiet!' from the App Store and replaced it with 'Remotely Quiet.' He also told us that it's as hard to pull an app from the App Store as it is to get it in there in the first place, which is kind of funny.<br/><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-406" title="The Quiets today" src="/uploads/2011/05/after-580x342.png" alt="The Quiets today" width="580" height="342" />
