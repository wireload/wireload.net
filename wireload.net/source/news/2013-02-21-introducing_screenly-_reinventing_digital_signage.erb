Digital Signage is something that has been around for some time. You can find digital signs everywhere today. They are used for everything from displaying the menu at your local fast food restaurant to covering buildings with ads to in-store advertisement.<br/>When we analyzed this market we noticed that most of the products fell into one of two buckets:<br/><ul><br/><li>Bloated and overpriced embedded solutions with decent functionality.</li><br/><li>Home-made solutions (that were often buggy and reliant on Adobe Flash).</li><br/></ul><br/>What we wanted was an affordable, modern and lightweight solution, but there weren't any around.<br/>When the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> was announced, we had an 'aha' moment. This was what was needed to reinvent the industry. At only $35 it was accessible for everyone. Not only that, the hardware was powerful enough to support full-HD playback.<br/><!--more--><br/>After spending a few months on the waitlist, we got our Rasperry Pi last summer and got busy cranking out a prototype. The result is a product that we call <a href="http://www.screenlyapp.com/">Screenly</a> - a turn-key digital signage solution. All you need to manage it is your web-browser.<br/><img src="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screenly_OSE_overview-580x418.png" alt="Screenly OSE" /><br/>Screenly is available in two flavors: OSE and Pro. <br/><strong>Screenly OSE</strong> is Open Source. Anyone can install, modify and use it free of charge. This edition is available today. All you need to install Screenly OSE is a more or less a Raspberry Pi and a TV. The installation instructions can be found <a href="http://www.screenlyapp.com/ose.html">here</a>. The limitation with Screenly OSE is that it was designed for a stand-alone setup. If all you need is to setup a single screen, Screenly OSE is the perfect fit for you. You can find an online demo <a href="http://ose.demo.screenlyapp.com">here</a>. The full source code for Screenly OSE is available on <a href="https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose">Github</a>.<br/><strong>Screenly Pro</strong> on the other hand is a commercial solution. It was designed for users who want to manage multiple nodes (or screens). It runs on the same hardware as Screenly OSE, but it provides you with a central interface. Screenly Pro also provides you with other benefits such as system hardening, node alarm/health and more. Screenly Pro is currently in beta, but you can read more about it <a href="http://www.screenlyapp.com/">here</a>.<br/>
