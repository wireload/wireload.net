I just wanted to post a brief note and inform you that we had some issues with incoming and outgoing emails yesterday and part of today. The problem was caused by some DNS settings that did not propagate properly when we moved our email server.<br/>Please note that this <strong>did not</strong> affect YippieMove's ability to transfer email. It did however prevent email notifications from being sent out.<br/>Sorry for the inconvenience.
