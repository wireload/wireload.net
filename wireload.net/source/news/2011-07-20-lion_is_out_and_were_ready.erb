Just 30 minutes ago or so, Mac OS X Lion was <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12">released</a> in the Mac App Store. We're as excited about this as the rest of the blogosphere, and we just wanted to let you know that both <a href="http://wireload.net/products/blotter/">Blotter</a> and <a href="http://wireload.net/products/quiet/">Quiet</a> are fully compatible with OS X Lion.
