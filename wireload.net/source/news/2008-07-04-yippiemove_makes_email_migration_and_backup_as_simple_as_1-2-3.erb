MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA  -- July 4, 2008 --  WireLoad has today unveiled their email migration service YippieMove. For $9.95, YippieMove will transfer email from any one of 40 e-mail providers, or any account that supports IMAP, which allows the user to switch accounts or make a backup.<br/>If you have ever been in a situation where you needed to leave an email account behind, you know that migrating (or transferring) all those emails from one account to another can be a real challenge. YippieMove makes this a breeze. With YippieMove, you no longer need to be a tech-savvy engineer to figure out how to transfer your email.<br/>Best of all, YippieMove has been designed to integrate seamlessly with Gmail. This means you can get hooked up with one of the leading email providers in minutes.<br/>YippieMove helps you migrate all your emails in three simple steps. First, choose one of the 40+ pre-configured account types (see http://yippiemove.com/about.html for a complete listing), or "other," to enter the information manually (this can be any IMAP compatible server). Next, plug in your Gmail or Google Apps credentials. Finally select what folders to transfer.<br/>Your emails will be transfered and organized into folders on the destination account as soon as possible. “We don?t think email migration could get any easier than this,” says Viktor Petersson, co-founder of WireLoad. “We really spent a great amount of time working on simplicity. The teach savvy users may be able to transfer their emails already, but we wanted anyone to be able to do this.”<br/>YippieMove also offers migration for groups or enterprises that want on-demand, hassle-free email migration. This service can be used to migrate emails between any two IMAP-compatible servers.
