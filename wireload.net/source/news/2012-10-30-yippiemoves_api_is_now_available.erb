Like most early products, it was rough around the edges, but did the job. We've come a long way since then.<br/>During these years, we've had the pleasure of working with both small and large clients. It has been a very exciting and rewarding journey. Now it is time to take the next step in YippieMove's evolution. After about a year of hard work, we are now extremely proud to announce the availability of YippieMove's <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/api.html">API</a>. <br/>With the API, you can more or less do everything you can on the regular site. With just a few API-calls, you can create and monitor transfers. As an example, a company like GoDaddy could integrate YippieMove into their sign-up process and enable users to migrate over their old email archive without ever leaving the sign-up wizard.<br/><!--more--><br/>In the last few years, we've been approached by many potential clients who wanted more than just a custom email migration portal (which we've <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/custom_domain.html">offered for some time</a>). They were primarily looking to seamlessly integrate an email migration tool in their existing control panel or application. Now, with the API available, that's possible.<br/>To give you an idea of what the API can do we've created a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) in Python based on YippieMove's API. The tool allows you to create transfers and the workflow mimiks the behavior of the regular YippieMove.com. You can download this tool, along with the complete source code directly from <a href="https://github.com/wireload/yippiemove-cli">GitHub</a>.<br/><a href="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/YippieMove_CLI.png"><img src="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/YippieMove_CLI-580x430.png" alt="" title="YippieMove CLI" width="580" height="430" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1450" /></a><br/><center><em>YippieMove's CLI in action.</em></center><br/>In order to make the development of applications on top of YippieMove easier, we've created a complete sandbox-environment that allows you test-run and develop your application without worrying about spending real money or actually transferring emails. The sandbox is available at <a href="sandbox.yippiemove.com">sandbox.yippiemove.com</a> and <a href="api.sandbox.yippiemove.com">api.sandbox.yippiemove.com</a>.<br/>The full documentation for the API, along with a tutorial that walks you through the process of creating a transfer, can be found <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/api.html">here</a>.<br/>Happy hacking!
