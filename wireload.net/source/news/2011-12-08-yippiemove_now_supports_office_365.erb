<img src="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Office_365.png" alt="" title="Office_365" width="250" height="80" class="alignright size-full wp-image-986" />If you're thinking of moving into or out of Microsoft's Office 365, you're in luck. <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com">YippieMove</a> can now help you migrate email data both in and out.<br/>Unfortunately the workflow isn't as streamlined as we'd like it to be due to the fact that the server-address differs between each instance. Regardless if you are moving to or from Office 365, you need to locate the address to the IMAP-server. To get this data, log into Outlook Web App (OWA) and go to "<strong>Options</strong>" in the upper right-hand corner, and then click on "<strong>Settings for POP, IMAP, and SMTP access...</strong>". <br/>This should bring up a new window with the information. The address should look something like xyz.outlook.com.<br/>Once you've have this piece of information, you can now use YippieMove. In <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/step/1/">Step 1</a> (or 2), provide YippieMove with your full email-address as the username, your password. Select the option 'Other' and enter the address you found above in the 'Host' field, and check the SSL-checkbox (which should change the port to 993). <br/>If you're performing a <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/batch_migration.html">batch-migration</a>, simply use the same settings as mentioned above for src/dst_host, src/dst_host, src/dst_port, src/dst_ssl in the CSV-file.<br/>Unfortunately, there seem to be no way to authenticate to the users' mailboxes via the admin-account like we described in <a href="http://wireload.net/2011/12/migrate-to-or-from-microsoft-exchange-without-resetting-the-users-passwords/">this article</a> with Office 365.
