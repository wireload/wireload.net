<a href="http://www.yippiemove.com">YippieMove</a> is great for transferring email between email accounts. However, if you are moving between two Gmail accounts, or perhaps from Gmail to Google Apps, you might want to bring with you more than just email. One thing you might want to bring with you is filters. To solve that, we've put together a brief guide on how to do this. <br/><h3>Enable the required Google Labs add-on</h3><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Log into your Gmail account</li><br/>	<li>Click Settings in the upper right-hand corner</li><br/>	<li>Go to the "Labs"-tab</li><br/>	<li>Find the "Filter import/export" add-on and set it to "Enable." Press "Save Changes"</li><br/></ol><br/><h3>Export filters</h3><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Click Settings in the upper right-hand corner</li><br/>	<li>Go to the "Filters"-tab</li><br/>	<li>Use the checkboxes next to your filters to select the filters to export</li><br/>	<li>Press "Export"</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><h3>Import filters</h3><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Click Settings in the upper right-hand corner</li><br/>	<li>Go to the "Filters"-tab</li><br/>	<li>Press "Import filters" and select the file from the export</li><br/></ol><br/>
