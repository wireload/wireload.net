MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA -- April 29, 2009 -- WireLoad announces support for Yahoo Mail in their popular email transfer tool YippieMove. For the first time email can easily be moved in and out of Yahoo Mail accounts.<br/>Yahoo Mail, the world’s largest provider of email services, does not by itself provide any method for users to transfer email en masse between different accounts and providers. YippieMove breaks down this barrier and enables average users to migrate their own email to or from Yahoo Mail accounts.<br/>“Since we launched YippieMove, our customers have been asking for support for Yahoo Mail. It was simply a natural step for us,” said Viktor Petersson, Managing Director at WireLoad.<br/>“While many modern email providers, such as Google’s Gmail, have opened up to allow easy access to a user’s email, Yahoo Mail users are still locked in,” continued Mr Petersson. “This is why we are proud to announce support for Yahoo Mail in YippieMove. Finally, this vendor lock-in is broken, and users are free to move their emails in and out of Yahoo.”<br/>YippieMove now has a potential reach of over a third of the world’s email users. Users can transfer mailboxes to and from Yahoo Mail as well as any of the more than 100 different email providers currently supported. The online based service requires no downloads and leaves email intact with dates and attachments preserved.<br/>YippieMove is available today at <a href="http://www.YippieMove.com">http://www.YippieMove.com</a> for $14.95. YippieMove is also available for groups or enterprises that want on-demand, hassle-free email migration.
