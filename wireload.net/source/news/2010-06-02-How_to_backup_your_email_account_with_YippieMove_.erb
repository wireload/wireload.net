1. Make sure your email account support IMAP. Most do, but there are certain providers that do not (such as Hotmail and Comcast).<br/>2. Create a backup-account. This can be any account that support IMAP (or is supported by YippieMove). Some good free options which offers plenty of storage space include Gmail and Yahoo. We also recommend that you use a different password on your backup-account. Moreover, it might be wise to use a different service for your backup-account (ie. if your regular account is a Gmail-account, you should probably not use Gmail for your backup).<br/>3. Create a YippieMove transfer with the account you want to backup as the source account, and your newly created backup-account as the destination account. You may also want to add a prefix using the 'Use a name pattern'-feature. This allows you to enter a prefix to the folders being created on the backup-account (ie. the date of the backup). <br/>4. Let YippieMove do its magic, and once it is done, you will have a complete copy of your source account on the destination account. <br/>[gallery columns="2"]
