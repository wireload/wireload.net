During the past year, we've received a few request from users asking if it's possible to move messages with YippieMove from a specific year. We do not have a specific feature for this, but here's a simple workaround. <br/>These instructions are specific for Gmail, but you can most likely use the same approach (with minor modifications) with other providers and email clients too. <br/><!--more--><br/><h3>In Gmail</h3><br/><ul><br/><li>Press the 'Show search options'-link to the right of the search bar.</li><br/><a href="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Show-search-options.png"><img src="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Show-search-options-450x33.png" alt="" title="Show search options" width="450" height="33" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-514" /></a><br/><li>You can ignore all fields but the 'Date within.' In this field you need to enter the start date. The search will display all messages from that that and 12 months forward. Press 'Search Mail.'</li><br/><a href="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gmail_search.png"><img src="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gmail_search-450x72.png" alt="Gmail Search" title="Gmail Search" width="450" height="72" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-513" /></a><br/><li>Verify that the search result looks reasonable.</li><br/><li>If the result is looking reasonable, select the messages using the button next to 'Archive' and chose 'All.'</li><br/><a href="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Select.png"><img src="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Select.png" alt="Select All" title="Select All" width="96" height="157" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-517" /></a><br/><li>Press 'Select all conversations that match this search.'</li><br/><li>The last step is to add all these messages to a Label.

You can verify the result by selecting the label in the left bar.</li> <br/></ul><br/><h3>In YippieMove</h3><br/>You can now use <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com">YippieMove</a> as usual. Enter your source account in Step 1 (the account above) and the account you want to move to in Step 2. In Step 3, you will find a list of all labels. If you only want the above messages, press 'Batch actions' and 'Deselect all folders' and then click the checkbox next to the label you created above. <br/><a href="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/batch-action.png"><img src="http://blog.yippiemove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/batch-action-450x36.png" alt="Batch Action" title="Batch Action" width="450" height="36" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-522" /></a><br/>That's it. Let us know if you have any questions or comment.
