With the release of Mavericks (OS X 10.9), we've decided to withdraw
[Quiet](http://wireload.net/products/quiet/) from Mac App Store. We've
received a large number of requests on Twitter and via our Support Forum
about this, which is why we want to clarify our reason for this.

The reason for this decision is two-fold:

-   Since the last release of Quiet, Apple have made significant changes
    to the regulations in Mac App Store. These regulations prevents us
    from releasing an update of Quiet without a significant rewrite (and
    it is still unclear if it is even possible).
-   There are some stability issues (and usability) issues with Quiet on
    OS X Mavericks. Due to the above reason, we cannot simply submit a
    fix that addresses these issues.

At this point it is uncertain if/when we will release an update to
Quiet.
