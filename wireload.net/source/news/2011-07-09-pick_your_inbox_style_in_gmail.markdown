Google just
[announced](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-pick-your-favorite-inbox-style.html)
a pretty neat feature to the Gmail interface. You can now select what
'inbox style' you like to display. The options are:

-   Classic
-   Important first
-   Unread first
-   Starred first

The different styles are rather self-explanatory. For more information,
see the original
[blog-post](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-pick-your-favorite-inbox-style.html).
We think this is a pretty nifty new feature to combat information
overflow.
