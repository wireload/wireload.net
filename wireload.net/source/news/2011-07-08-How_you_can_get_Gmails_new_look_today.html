Two days ago, we ran a <a href="http://wireload.net/2011/07/a-sneak-preview-of-the-new-gmail-web-interface/">post</a> about Gmail's new web interface. It was intended as a brief note to our users pointing back to Google's <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/preview-of-gmails-new-look.html">original post</a>. <br/>Little did we know that this particular post would get 10k visitors in 48 hours. Most users appears to be confused, thinking we were Google and asking us for various features. We are not Google, nor are we affiliated with Google in any way. <br/>With that said, you can actually get Gmail's new interface today.<br/><!--more--><br/><h3>How you can get the new interface</h3><br/>All you need to do is to go to 'Mail Settings' (click the icon in the upper-right hand corner), and go to 'Themes' tab. Then pick either 'Preview' or 'Preview (dense).' That's it. <br/><img src="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Settings_themes-580x441.png" alt="Getting Gmail&#039;s new interface" title="Getting Gmail&#039;s new interface" width="580" height="441" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-676" /><br/><h3>Gmail's old interface</h3><br/><img src="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/before-580x441.png" alt="Before - Old Gmail interface" title="Before - Old Gmail interface" width="580" height="441" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-674" /><br/><h3>Gmail's new interface</h3><br/><img src="http://wireload.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/after-580x441.png" alt="The new Gmail interface" title="The new Gmail interface" width="580" height="441" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-675" />
