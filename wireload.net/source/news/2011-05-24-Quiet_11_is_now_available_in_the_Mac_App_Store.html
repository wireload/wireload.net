We're excited to introduce <a href="http://wireload.net/products/quiet/">Quiet</a> 1.1. We have some great new features lined up and we think you'll really like them.<br/>First, you can now use your wallpaper as the background when going into Quiet mode. The visually stunning 'focus out' effect also remains, but now runs faster than ever. <br/>Second, you can now configure a custom IM away message. By default Quiet will set your message to <em>"I'm in the zone"</em> but now you can get creative about how you want to let people know you're wired in.<br/>We've also added an option to use Quiet on multiple Spaces. This allows you to stay 'away' and not be bothered by notifications even while you're working on more than one Mac OS X Space. Another new option is to disable the menu bar icon entirely. All of this is in addition to a lot of improvements under the hood to make Quiet run smoother and leaner than ever.<!--more--><br/>And how will all these new features change the price? We are lowering it.
