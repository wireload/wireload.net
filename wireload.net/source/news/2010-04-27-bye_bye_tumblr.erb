Today we decided to move this blog over to our own servers, after giving <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> a shot. While Tumblr might be the new and cool blogging service, they failed on us on one tiny, but rather important, aspect. In 9/10 cases when we tried to access the 'Dashboard' to post updates to the blog, it failed.<br/>Therefor we moved this blog over to our own servers and configured a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog. We know that the blog does not look as sexy as it used to over at Tumblr (yet), but we pick reliability over sexyness every time.
