Great news everyone! <a href="http://wireload.net/products/blotter/">Blotter</a> 1.4 is now available as a free update in the Mac App Store.<br/>So what's new, you may ask. That's a very good question, and here is the answer:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Adds Mac OS X Lion compatibility.</li><br/>	<li>Fixes a bug where the preferences window would open unintentionally.</li><br/>	<li>Resolves issues with incorrectly displayed time after waking up from sleep or when changing time zones.</li><br/></ul>
