We want to say a big thank you to all of our users. You guys rock! As I'm writing this, Blotter is shooting up in the rankings. It is currently ranked #22 in the entire US Mac App Store, and #4 in the productivity category. We're also doing really well in the UK market, where we're ranked #38 in the entire Mac App Store, and #5 in the productivity category.  <br/>Thank you for all the support. Also, make sure you check in on a regular basis, as we have some really cool products that we are yet to announce.
