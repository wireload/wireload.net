However, don't think for a second that we've been slacking off. In fact, we've been working really hard on making Blotter 2.1 awesome, and we know that you will love it. <br/>Perhaps the most exciting new feature is the new "Bring to Front". This feature will pop Blotter up on top of your windows for a quick peek at your calendar. As a result, regardless of how cluttered your desktop is, Blotter is still easily accessible.<br/>Another major new (and highly requested) feature is the ability to navigate between weeks in the past and in the future using either the keyboard shortcuts (or from the menu). This means that Blotter no longer is limited to viewing the current week. You can now jump back and forth in time as much as you'd like. Combined with the "Bring to Front"-feature, Blotter becomes an amazingly powerful calendar viewer. <br/>On top of both those major features, we've also polished Blotter look and made it even lighter and more beautiful to look at. <br/>Here's the complete change log:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Use "Bring to Front" to view Blotter even when there are many windows on your display. </li><br/>	<li>Navigate between weeks to view coming or past weeks.</li><br/>	<li>Improved layout on small screens such as with the 11" MacBook Air. </li><br/>	<li>Improved handling of duplicate events from different calendars. </li><br/>	<li>Resolved an issue where Blotter would not fade out. </li><br/>	<li>Better support for right-to-left text. </li><br/>	<li>Minor bug fixes.</li><br/></ul><br/>If you haven't bought your copy of Blotter yet, you can buy your copy direct from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blotter/id406580224?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>.<br/>To learn more about Blotter, please visit the <a href="http://wireload.net/products/blotter/">product page</a>. <br/>Please note that this is a <strong>free update</strong> to everyone who've purchased Blotter.
