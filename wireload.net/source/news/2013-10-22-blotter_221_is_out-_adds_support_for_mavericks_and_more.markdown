Today Apple released the latest version of Mac OS X named
[Mavericks](https://www.apple.com/osx/). Simultaneously, we released a
new version of [Blotter](http://wireload.net/products/blotter/) that is
fully compatible with Mavericks. In addition to this, the new version of
Blotter also adds support for Japanese.

The new version of Blotter also includes the following enhancements:

-   Fixes an issue that may cause a crash in Mac OS X 10.7.
-   Resolves an issue with deselecting external calendars (such as from
    Google).
-   Restores the ability to set any function keys as keyboard shortcuts.
