MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA -- April 8, 2009 -- WireLoad has today unveiled YippieMove ’09, an updated version of their popular email transfer tool YippieMove. If you have ever been in a situation where you wanted switch your email provider, you know that migrating (or transferring) all those emails from one account to another can be a real challenge. With YippieMove’s intuitive web interface, you no longer need to be a tech-savvy engineer to resolve the problem. <br/>YippieMove ’09 comes with three major new updates: Anywhere to anywhere, Enhanced progress reports and Up to 2x faster transfers. <br/><strong>Anywhere to Anywhere</strong><br/>The most revolutionary new feature in YippieMove ’09 is the ability to transfer emails between virtually any two email providers. Prior to the release, YippieMove was limited to transfer emails to Gmail and Google Apps. With this release, a world of new opportunities has opened. YippieMove comes pre-configured with more than 100 different email providers. If your provider is not listed, you can even enter your own details.<br/><strong>Enhanced Progress Reports</strong><br/>The new release includes a completely rewritten status page. This allows you to see information such as the speed of which we transfer your emails, how many messages and folders we have completed etc. We are now able to provide you with this data in almost real time. To visualize this data, we use interactive graphs. <br/><strong>Up to 2x Faster Transfers</strong><br/>The final update is under the hood of YippieMove. We’ve spent a lot of time optimizing the speed of YippieMove for this release. We’ve rewritten a large portion of our proprietary mover software that powers YippieMove in the back-end. According to our internal benchmarks, we’ve seen the new mover outperform the old version by up to 100%<br/>The service is available today at <a href="http://www.YippieMove.com">http://www.YippieMove.com</a> for $14.95. YippieMove also offers migration for groups or enterprises that want on-demand, hassle-free email migration.<br/>
