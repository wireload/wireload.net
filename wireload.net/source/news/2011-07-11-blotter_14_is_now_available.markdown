Great news everyone! [Blotter](http://wireload.net/products/blotter/)
1.4 is now available as a free update in the Mac App Store.

So what's new? That's a very good question, and here is the
answer:

-   Adds Mac OS X Lion compatibility.
-   Fixes a bug where the preferences window would open unintentionally.
-   Resolves issues with incorrectly displayed time after waking up from
    sleep or when changing time zones.
