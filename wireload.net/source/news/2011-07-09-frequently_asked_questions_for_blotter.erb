One of the most frustrating things with the Mac App Store as a developer is that you cannot respond to users' feedback. Some users are giving applications a bad review because they don't understand how to do X or Y, and prefer to voice their opinion in a review, instead of looking in the <a href="http://support.wireload.net/forums/356140-frequently-asked-questions">FAQ</a> or <a href="http://support.wireload.net">contacting</a> the vendor. As a developer, this is really frustrating. <a href="http://wireload.net/2011/07/dear-users-youre-awesome/">We love our users</a>, and we want everybody who purchase our products to be happy. We also listen to the feedback we receive. However, within the Mac App Store, we cannot respond to the reviews, nor can we provide the solution to the problem a user bring up. <br/>While you might argue that the developers failed to provide an intuitive enough user interface, it is almost impossible to write an interface that fits everyone.  <br/><!--more--><br/><h3>Is Google Calendar supported in Blotter?</h3><br/>Yes. All you need to do is to add your Google Calendar to iCal. Details on how to do this are available <a href="http://support.wireload.net/entries/455852-can-i-use-blotter-with-my-google-calendar">here</a>.<br/><h3>Is Blotter Mac OS X Lion compatible?</h3><br/>Version 1.3 of Blotter isn't fully compatible with Mac OS X Lion unfortunately. We have submitted version 1.4 to Apple, which will be Lion compatible. <br/><br/><h3>How can I view my delegate calendars?</h3><br/>This is unfortunately a major inconvenience. The problem is that iCal's API (the way Blotter talks to iCal) doesn't support delegate calendars very well. We have published a workaround <a href="http://support.wireload.net/entries/455889-help-some-of-my-google-calendar-exchange-calendars-don-t-show-up">here</a>, but this solution isn't as smooth as we would like it to be.<br/><h3>Why doesn't the color of my calendars match iCals?</h3><br/>Most of the colors do. Some colors however looked really washed out with the opacity we're using, so we decided to replace them. More information about this is available <a href="http://support.wireload.net/entries/20150262-why-are-the-colors-different-between-blotter-and-ical">here</a>.<br/><h3>How do I configure what day of the week Blotter starts with?</h3><br/>Blotter is using the system setting for this. All you need to do is to configure your system to your preference. Instructions on how to do that is available <a href="http://support.wireload.net/entries/20071573-can-i-change-what-day-of-the-week-blotter-starts-with">here</a>.<br/>Many more questions and answers can be found in our <a href="http://support.wireload.net/forums/356140-frequently-asked-questions">FAQ</a>.
