Due to an increased number of issues with Yahoo Mail lately, we've decided to downgrade our support for Yahoo Mail from stable to 'experimental'. Users are still welcome to use YippieMove to migrate to and from Yahoo Mail with YippieMove - just be aware there is a chance that the migration will not be successful. This primarily affects migrations to Yahoo Mail, and not migrations from Yahoo Mail to the same extent. <br/>Unfortunately the problem is not on our side, so there is not much we can do to improve this situation. <br/>If we are unable to reach the 95% success rate promised in our transfer guarantee, we will issue a refund.
