We are only basing this on public information (primarily from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/exchangelabshelp/ee730334">this</a> article). Yet, it sounds reasonable, and feel free comment below and correct us. <br/>Similar to both <a href="http://wireload.net/2011/11/how-to-migrate-to-or-from-dovecot-without-reseting-the-users-passwords/">Dovecot</a> and <a href="http://wireload.net/2011/12/migrate-to-or-from-microsoft-exchange-without-resetting-the-users-passwords/">Microsoft Exchange</a>, Mirapoint Message Server also support logging into users' accounts via the admin account by using a modified username-string.<br/><!--more--><br/>The username string Mirapoint Message Server is using for admin-authentication looks as follows:<br/><pre lang="bash"><br/>#user@example.com#AdminUserName#<br/></pre><br/>Hence, if your admin-account is 'jdoe', and you're trying to access the account 'jsmith@example.com', your string would look like this:<br/><pre lang="bash"><br/>#jsmith@example.com#jdoe#<br/></pre><br/>Before you move forward with the migration, make sure you can login using this method (the custom username-string mentioned above, along with the admin-password) using a desktop client, like Thunderbird, or using OpenSSL as we did in the <a href="http://wireload.net/2011/11/how-to-migrate-to-or-from-dovecot-without-reseting-the-users-passwords/">Dovecot-guide</a>.<br/>Once you've verified that you can login, you can proceed with your YippieMove e-mail migration. You can either do a <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/step/1/">single-migration</a>, or use the <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/batch_migration.html">batch-migration</a> tool.<br/>If you got any questions, please let us know either by <a href="http://support.yippiemove.com">contacting the support</a> or comment below.
