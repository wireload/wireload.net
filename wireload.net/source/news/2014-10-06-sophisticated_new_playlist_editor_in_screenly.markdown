While things have been quiet around here, we certainly have not been lazy. To the contrary, it means that we've been super busy.

Today, we're happy to unveil one of the things that we have been working on: a significantly improved playlist creation and editing.

We think it is one of the most sophisticated playlist editors in the digital signage industry. Contrary to most playlist editors with advanced features, we have really focused on simplification. The goal has been to be able to enable advanced scheduling, without making simple scheduling more complicated.

What we have come up with is a rule based editor. Take a look at the following screenshot showing the new editor:

<span class="shadowed"><img src="/uploads/2014/10/Screenly_Lunch_menu_screenshot.png" alt="Screenly's sophisticated new playlist editor" /><span class="sh tl"></span><span class="sh tr"></span><span class="sh bl"></span><span class="sh br"></span></span><br/><br/>

What you can see here is a typical lunch menu, which is something that we've had numerous requests for. In addition to the regular start and end date, you'll also notice that we've specified the following:

 * Only play on weekdays (Mon-Fri)
 * Only play between 11:30 - 13:30

Using this new rule based playlist editor, you can create very sophisticated schedules by combining conditions with **AND** and **OR**. This enables you to cover most potential use cases for scheduling, while still making it easy to understand (as it almost reads like a normal sentence).

With the introduction of this new playlist editor, we also had to make some changes to the way we display the scheduled assets for a given node. Previously, we simply listed the assets you had scheduled in this view. Now with these new functionalites, it becomes a tad more complicated.

The way we have resolved this is to simply display all relevant assets. Hence we've renamed this to *Assets in rotation*. Please note that just because an asset is listed here, doesn't mean that it is showing on the screen at the current time. This is dictated by the playlist itself.

In addition to this major update to the playlist module, we've also rolled out a number of other smaller improvements to Screenly that will improve the overall experience of Screenly.
