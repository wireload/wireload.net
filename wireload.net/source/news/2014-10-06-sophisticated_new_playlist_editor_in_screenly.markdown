While things have been quiet around here, we certainly have not been lazy. To the contrary, it means that we've been super busy.

Today, we're happy to unveil one of the things that we have been working on: a significantly improved playlist editor.

We think it is one of the most sophisticated playlist editors in the digital signage industry. Contrary to most playlist editors with advanced features, we have really focused on simplification. The goal has been to be able to enable advanced scheduling without making simple scheduling more complicated.

What we have come up with is a rule-based editor. Take a look at the following screenshot:

What you can see here is a typical lunch menu, which is something that we've had numerous requests for. In addition to the regular start and end date, you'll also notice that we've specified the following:

 * Only play on weekdays (Mon-Fri)
 * Only play between 11:30 - 13:30

Using this new rule based playlist editor, you can create very precise schedules by combining conditions with **AND** and **OR**. This enables all your advanced scheduling needs, while still being easy to understand (as it almost reads like a normal sentence).

With the introduction of this new playlist editor, we also had to make some changes to the way we display the scheduled assets for a given node. Since playlists might turn on and off frequently, just listing all assets as they come and go would be repetitive.

Instead, we now give you a concise overview of which assets are active in the screen in the new *Assets in rotation* section, listing each asset only once even if it repeats multiple times. Please note that just because an asset is listed here it doesn't mean that it is showing on the screen at the current time. That is dictated by the playlist itself.

In addition to this major update to the playlist editor, we've also rolled out a number of other smaller improvements to Screenly that will improve the overall experience of Screenly.
