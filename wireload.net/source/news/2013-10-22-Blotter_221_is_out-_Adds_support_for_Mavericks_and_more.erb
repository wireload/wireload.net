Today Apple released the latest version of Mac OS X named <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/">Mavericks</a>. Simultaneously, we released a new version of <a href="http://wireload.net/products/blotter/">Blotter</a> that is fully compatible with Mavericks. In addition to this, the new version of Blotter also adds support for Japanese. <br/>The new version of Blotter also includes the following enhancements:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Fixes an issue that may cause a crash in Mac OS X 10.7. </li><br/>	<li>Resolves an issue with deselecting external calendars (such as from Google). </li><br/>	<li>Restores the ability to set any function keys as keyboard shortcuts. </li><br/></ul>
