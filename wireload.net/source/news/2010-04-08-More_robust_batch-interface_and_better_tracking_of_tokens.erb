<p>Over the last few weeks we've seen an amazing growth in the number of users. Not only are we seeing a lot more single-transfers, but are also seeing an increased adoption of our <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/batch_migration.html">Batch Migration-tool</a>. We are really excited about this, and we think that our <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/batch_migration.html">Batch Migration-tool</a> fills a big gap in the market (in particular since it can be used with most servers/services, including Google Apps Standard).<br /><br />The new update we just rolled out to the batch-interface makes it much more robust. It adds better error handling when uploading invalid files (such as Excel-files). We've also made it smarter. For instance, if you forgot to fill out some piece of critical data in the file you uploaded, our system will in most cases identify this and tell you what is missing (line number and value). We do still find errors that we haven't built in handling for, but we will try to continuously improve on this as we discover them.<br /><br />This update also adds way to track the usage of tokens (which we announced last week). The feature is very straight forward: every time a token is used, an email will be sent to the token-owner informing him or her about the remaining balance.<br /><br />Last, but definitely not least, we've added a very important feature for people who are moving to destinations that are not Gmail, Google Apps or Yahoo (and perhaps a few other). The new feature is better handling of the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3501#section-6.3.6">SUBSCRIBE</a>-flag on folders. For those of you who do not know what the SUBSCRIBE-flat does on folders in IMAP, it is what determines if a folder is visible or not in a desktop client (and for certain webmails).<br /><br />In the past we have had limited support for the SUBSCRIBE-flag, as the vast majority of our users are moving to Google Apps or Gmail. However, as we have grown, the number of users requesting better support for this also increased. Since we really value and listen to user feedback, we've put our money where our mouth is and resolved this. The default action is now that we add the SUBSCRIBE-flag to all folders we create, but we leave the current setting for existing folders.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy these new features.
