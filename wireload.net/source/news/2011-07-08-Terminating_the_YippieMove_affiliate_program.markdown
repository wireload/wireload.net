About three years ago, we
[introduced](http://www.playingwithwire.com/2009/01/yippiemove-now-features-an-affiliate-program/)
an affiliate program for [YippieMove](http://www.yippiemove.com). The
idea with the program was simple. We wanted to enable bloggers to earn a
cut of each transaction that was generated from visitors they sent us.

Despite the fact that we do get a small amount of traffic from the
affiliate program, the program did not turn out to be the success we
were hoping for. Today the administrative cost of keeping this program
alive exceed what it brings in. As a result, we've decided to terminate
the program.

All affiliates will be contacted shortly, and all current balances will
be payed out.
